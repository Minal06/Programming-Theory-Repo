# Programming-Theory-Repo

This was the final test for my Unity Junior Programmer Certificate.

I had to prepare game from scratch with main focus on **object-oriented programming**.

## Rules
Simple race game for two players. 

Each competitor has a one minute to reach goal line as many times as possible. 

Whoever score more points wins.

## Notes
This game project was based on Atari classic Space Race.

I used object pooling for all the obstacles spawning.

Spawned obstacles are checking their positions and start to move accordingly.

All the players options can be setup and adjusted inside Unity editor. 

I was trying to implement all the Object-oriented programming rules in this game, to the best of my knowledge.
